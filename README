sensei-raw-ctl

This program makes it possible to change the configuration of your SteelSeries
Sensei Raw mouse from within Linux, *BSD or any other POSIX-compatible system
supported by libusb.

Run `sensei-raw-ctl --help' or `man sensei-raw-ctl' for usage information.

If you don't fancy command line tools, there's also a basic GTK+ frontend
available.  On Ubuntu and its derivates, you should be able to find it in your
System Settings.

Supported devices
=================
 - SteelSeries Sensei Raw
 - SteelSeries Call of Duty: Black Ops II
 - SteelSeries Guild Wars 2

Installation
============
Build dependencies: cmake >= 2.8.5, help2man, libusb >= 1.0,
                    gtk+ >= 3.0 (optional)

$ git clone git://github.com/pjanouch/sensei-raw-ctl.git
$ cd sensei-raw-ctl
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
# make install

Note that there's no "make uninstall" and the GUI needs to be installed in the
right location in order to work correctly.

If you don't want the GUI frontend, append -DBUILD_GUI=NO to the cmake command.
The GUI also isn't going to be built if you don't have the GTK+ 3 development
packages installed, if your distribution has any.

For Debian-based distros, you can do the following instead of the last step:
$ fakeroot cpack -G DEB
# dpkg -i sensei-raw-ctl-*.deb

Leave out the fakeroot for CMake >= 2.8.9, it's been fixed since.
