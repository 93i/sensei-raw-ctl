sensei-raw-ctl

This program makes it possible to change the configuration of your SteelSeries
Sensei Raw mouse from within Linux, *BSD or any other POSIX-compatible system
supported by libusb.

Installation
============
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
# make install

Note that there's no "make uninstall" and the GUI needs to be installed in the
right location to work correctly.

If you don't want the GUI frontend, append -DBUILD_GUI=NO to the cmake command.

For Debian-based distros, you can do the following instead of the last step:
$ cpack -G DEB
# dpkg -i sensei-raw-ctl-*.deb
